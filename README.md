The following is a very short introduction to the `ponchon-savarit` toolbox for GNU Octave.

This text is divided in two main sections: The Theory and The `ponchon-savarit` Toolbox.

# The Theory

The Ponch贸n-Savarit graphical method is a method to calculate the number of theoretical stages of equilibrium of a distillation column for a two component mixture. It allows for variations on the heat of vaporization, the most demanding premise of the McCabe-Thiele method. Ponch贸n-Savarit method demands that the column be adiabatic, except for its bottom and top, where there must heat exchange in order to maintain reflux streams.

Distillation is a unit operation based on the difference of volatility to separate different chemical species of a mixture and on gravity to separate vapor and liquid streams. There are several types of distillation.

Typically, continuous distillation is performed in a vertical column fed at its intermediate section while products at its top and bottom are recovered. As a rule of thumb, the higher the column, the higher the number of stages of equilibrium and the best is the separations of the components of the mixture fed.

## Theoretical Stage of Equilibrium

A theoretical stage of equilibrium is an abstract control volume such that the effluent currents are all in thermodynamic equilibrium. All multistage operations are based on the concept of stage of equilibrium.

## Material and Enthalpy Balances

The global and specific material balances and the enthalpy balance for any equilibrium stage *n* are given by

$$
V_{n-1} - L_n = V_n - L_{n+1}
$$

$$
V_{n-1}\ y_{n-1} - L_n\ x_n = V_n\ y_n - L_{n+1}\ x_{n+1}
$$

$$
V_{n-1}\ H_{n-1} - L_n\ h_n = V_n\ H_n - L_{n+1}\ h_{n+1}
$$

where *L*<sub>*n*+1</sub> and *V*<sub>*n*</sub> are the liquid and the vapor streams, *x*<sub>*n*+1</sub> and *y*<sub>*n*</sub> are compositions of liquid and vapor streams, and *h*<sub>*n*+1</sub> and *H*<sub>*n*</sub> are the material enthalpy of liquid and vapor streams.

For any theoretical stage of the rectifying section,

$$
{\it\Delta} = V_n - L_{n+1}
$$

$$
{\it\Delta}\ x_{\it\Delta} = V_n\ y_n - L_{n+1}\ x_{n+1}
$$

$$
{\it\Delta}\ h_{\it\Delta} = V_n\ H_n - L_{n+1}\ h_{n+1}
$$

where ${\it\Delta}$, *x*<sub>${\it\Delta}$</sub> and *h*<sub>${\it\Delta}$</sub> are the upcolumn stream of the rectifying section, its global composition and its enthalpy. Combining the three balances, one has

$$
{L_{n+1} \over V_n} = {y_n - x_\Delta \over x_{n+1} - x_\Delta} = {H_n - h_\Delta \over h_{n+1} - h_\Delta}
$$

Also, the material balances at the top of the column are

$$
D = V_n - L_{n+1}
$$

$$
D\ x_D = V_n\ y_n - L_{n+1}\ x_{n+1}
$$

where *D*, *x*<sub>*D*</sub> and *h*<sub>*D*</sub> are the distillate stream and its composition. It follows that ${\it\Delta}$ = *D* and *x*<sub>${\it\Delta}$</sub> = *x*<sub>*D*</sub>.

The ratio between the distillate *D* and the refluxing current *L*<sub>*N*+1</sub> is the reflux ratio at the top of the column,

$$
R = {L_{N+1} \over D} = {L_{N+1} \over {\it\Delta}}
$$

Given the enthalpy diagram of the vapor and the liquid at equilibrium and the composition of the distillate *x*<sub>*D*</sub> and the reflux ratio *R* it is possible to calculate *x*<sub>${\it\Delta}$</sub>. It is then possible to calculate *x*<sub>*n*+1</sub> from *y*<sub>*n*</sub> and *L*<sub>*n*+1</sub> from *V*<sub>*n*</sub> for any stage *n* of the rectifying section.

The balances of the column is given by

$$
F = {\it\Delta} + {\it\Lambda}
$$

$$
F\ x_F = {\it\Delta}\ x_{\it\Delta} + {\it\Lambda}\ x_{\it\Lambda}
$$

$$
F\ h_F = {\it\Delta}\ h_{\it\Delta} + {\it\Lambda}\ h_{\it\Lambda}
$$

where *x*<sub>*F*</sub> and *h*<sub>*F*</sub> are the composition and the enthalpy of the feed and ${\it\Lambda}$, *x*<sub>${\it\Lambda}$</sub> and *h*<sub>${\it\Lambda}$</sub> are the downcolumn stream of the stripping section and its composition and enthalpy.

The enthalpy of the feed *h*<sub>*F*</sub> can be calculated from the composition *x*<sub>*F*</sub> and the quality *q* of the feed,

$$
(1 - q)\ y_n + q\ x_{n+1} = x_F
$$

$$
(1 - q)\ H_n + q\ h_{n+1} = h_F
$$

So that

$$
{{\it\Lambda} \over {\it\Delta}} = {x_{\it\Delta} - x_F \over x_F - x_{\it\Lambda}} = {h_{\it\Delta} - h_F \over h_F - h_{\it\Lambda}}
$$

Analogously to the rectifying section,
${\it\Lambda}$ = *B* and *x*<sub>${\it\Lambda}$</sub> = *x*<sub>*B*</sub>,
where *B* and *x*<sub>*B*</sub> are the column's bottom product and its composition.

# The `ponchon-savarit` Toolbox

`ponchon-savarit` provides the following functions:

- `stages`
- `refmin`
- `qR2S`
- `qS2R`
- `RS2q`

## `stages`

`stages` computes the number of theoretical stages of a distillation column using the Ponch贸n-Savarit method given a *x*-*h*-*y*-*H* matrix of the liquid and the vapor fractions at equilibrium and their enthalpies, the vector of the fractions of the products and the feed and two paramaeters aong the feed quality, the reflux ratio at the top of the column and the reflux ratio at the bottom of the column.

By default, stages plots a schematic diagram of the solution, *fig* = *true*. If *fig* = *false* is given, no plot is shown.

By default, `stages` plots a schematic diagram of the solution, *fig* = *true*.

**Syntax:**

```dotnetcli

data=[0.    0.420 0.    1.840; # enthalpy in kcal/mmol
      0.075 0.418 0.193 1.755;
      0.17  0.415 0.359 1.685;
      0.275 0.410 0.50  1.625;
      0.39  0.398 0.63  1.570;
      0.525 0.378 0.75  1.515;
      0.685 0.349 0.86  1.465;
      0.88  0.300 0.955 1.425;
      1.    0.263 1.    1.405];
x=[0.88;0.44;0.08];
q=RS2q(data,x,2,1.3)
```
