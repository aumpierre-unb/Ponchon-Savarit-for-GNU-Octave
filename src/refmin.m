function [R,S]=refmin(data,X,q)
    # Syntax:
    # -- [R,S]=refmin(data,X,q)
    #
    # refmin computes the minimum reflux ratios
    #  of a distillation column
    #  using the Ponch√≥n-Savarit method given
    #  a x-h-y-H matrix of the liquid and the vapor fractions
    #  at equilibrium and their enthalpies,
    #  the vector of the fractions of the products and the feed and
    #  the feed quality.
    # If q = 1, q is reset to q = 1 - 1e-10.
    # refmin is a main function of
    #  the ponchon-savarit toolbox for GNU Octave.

    # # the composition of the feed is 46 %,
    # # the composition of the column's bottom product is 11 % and
