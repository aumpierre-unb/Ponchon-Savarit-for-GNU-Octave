function [R]=refmin(data,X,q)
    # Syntax:
    #
    # [R]=refmin(data,X,q)
    #
    # refmin computes the minimum value of the reflux ratio
    #  of a distillation column
    #  using the Ponchon-Savarit method given
    #  a x-h-y-H matrix of the liquid and the vapor fractions
    #  at equilibrium and their enthalpies,
    #  the vector of the fractions of the products and the feed and
    #  the feed quality.
    # If feed is a saturated liquid, feed quality q = 1,
    #  feed quality is reset to q = 1 - 1e-10.
    # refmin is a main function of
    #  the ponchon-savarit toolbox for GNU Octave.
